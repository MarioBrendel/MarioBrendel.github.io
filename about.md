Hi, I'm Mario Brendel, the Founder of this blog. My goal is to teach you everything about Angular2.
Currently I'm trying to get into Angular2 myself, so most of my tutorials will be from the view of a beginner. Since I'm a Java developer most of my code will look very object oriented, although I'll try to use [RxJs](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)/[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) from time to time.  
<br />
Since I'm not a native english speaker, there may be some grammatical errors. So if you find some ludicrous errors you can always correct me :).
Feel free to [mail me](mariob@mario-brendel.com) whenever you have suggestions or other things that are on your mind.
