Hey guys, this is just a quick update to inform you that all the future parts of the "Lets create a social media app" will be in video form and hosted on
youtube. I think its way easier to explain stuff via video. Nevertheless I'll still post general tutorials about angular 2 like testing and such stuff in text form.
All my videos will also appear on this blog so that you don't miss anything. <br/>
